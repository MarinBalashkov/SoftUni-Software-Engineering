                <h1>Principles For HTML clean code</h1>
            </header>
            <P>Beautiful and clean HTML is the foundation of a beautiful website. When I teach people about CSS, I always begin by telling them that good CSS can only exist with equally good HTML markup. A house is only as strong as its foundation, right? The advantages of clean, semantic HTML are many, yet so many websites suffer from poorly written markup.</P>
            <p>Strict DOCTYPE. If we are going to do this, letâ€™s just do it right. No need for a discussion about whether to use HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0: both of them offer a strict version that will keep us nice and honest as we write our code.</p>
            <p>Character set & encoding characters. In our <head> section, the very first thing should be the declaration of our character set. Weâ€™re using UTF-8 here, which is swell, but itâ€™s listed after our <title>. Letâ€™s go ahead and move it up so that the browser knows what character set itâ€™s dealing with before it starts reading any content at all</p>
            <p>The next time you write HTML, be it a small chunk in a huge website, or the beginning of a fresh new project, just do what you can to make it right.</p>
            <p>The interwebs will love you!</p>
